abstract: "The Shadow Program Committee (PC) is an initiative/program that provides an opportunity to Early-Career Researchers (ECRs), i.e., PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners, who have not been in a PC, to learn first-hand about the peer-review process of the technical track at Software Engineering (SE) conferences. This program aims to train the next generation of PC members as well as to allow ECRs to be recognized and embedded in the research community. By participating in this program, ECRs will have a great chance i) to gain experience about the reviewing process including the restrictions and ethical standards of the academic peer-review process; ii) to be mentored by senior researchers on how to write a good review; and iii) to create a network with other ECRs and senior researchers (i.e., Shadow PC advisors).


The Shadow PC program was first introduced to the SE research community at the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference in 2021. The program was led by Patanamon Thongtanunam and Ayushi Rastogi (Shadow PC Co-chairs) with support from Shadow PC Advisor Co-Chairs (Foutse Khomh and Serge Demeyer), PC Co-Chairs of the technical track (Meiyappan Nagappan and Kelly Blincoe), and the General Chair of the conference, Gregorio Robles. To promote and facilitate the Shadow PC program at SE conferences in the future, this report provides details about the process and a reflection on the Shadow PC program during MSR2021. The presentation slides and video are also available online at https://youtu.be/ReUXwmtIEk8.
