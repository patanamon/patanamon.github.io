abstract: "ReDA(<a href='http://reda.naist.jp/'>http://reda.naist.jp/</a>) is a web-based visualization tool for analyzing Modern Code Review (MCR) datasets for large Open Source Software (OSS) projects. MCR is a commonly practiced and lightweight inspection of source code using a support tool such as Gerrit system. Recently, mining code review history of such systems has received attention as a potentially effective method of ensuring software quality. However, due to increasing size and complexity of softwares being developed, these datasets are becoming unmanageable. ReDA aims to assist researchers of mining code review data by enabling better understand of dataset context and identifying abnormalities. Through real-time data interaction, users can quickly gain insight into the data and hone in on interesting areas to investigate. A video highlighting the main features can be found at: <a href='http://youtu.be/_fEoTRRas0U'>http://youtu.be/_fEoTRRas0U</a>"
